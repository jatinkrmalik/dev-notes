description: "The origin story of my tech obsession - from witnessing my first PC boot-up in 1998 to falling down the rabbit hole of programming and never looking back"
---

Ever wonder what turns a 5-year-old kid into a lifelong tech nerd? Let me take you back to that pivotal summer evening in 1998 that changed everything...

## The First Encounter

```bash
$ memory --recall --year=1998 --age=5
Loading childhood memory...
Location: Uncle's shop, R.K. Puram market
Status: Mind = blown
```

Picture this: It's just another summer evening, and my dad takes us to visit my uncle who's just started dealing in computing devices and office equipment. I'm 5, probably more interested in playing outside than whatever this "computer thing" is.

Then it happened.

My uncle had just finished assembling a brand new PC - and when I say "brand new," I mean cutting-edge 1998 technology:

```yaml
first_pc_specs:
  processor: "Pentium II 300MHz"
  memory: "32MB RAM"  # Yes, MEGAbytes
  storage: "4GB HDD"  # Massive for the time
  os: "Windows 95"
  monitor: "15-inch CRT"
  internet: "56K dial-up modem"
```

He connected everything, hit the power button, and that massive CRT monitor flickered to life with the Windows 95 boot screen. Then came the magic - he fired up the 56K modem, plugged in the MTNL landline, and that symphony of bleeps and bloops connected us to **the Internet**.

That was it. I was hooked.

Everyone kept saying "Computer is the future!" Back then, we had no idea how prophetic those words would be.

## Making It Personal

```javascript
const waitingPeriod = {
  duration: "8 years",
  motivation: "Score 90%+ in 8th grade",
  realReason: "Games and general mischief",
  parentalApproval: "Required extensive family lobbying"
};
```

Fast forward to 2005. After years of begging and a strategic deal with my dad (score over 90% in 8th grade = get a PC), I finally got my chance to build my own rig.

I spent weeks at the local cybercafe researching components like my life depended on it. The final configuration:

```bash
$ system-info --year=2005
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────────────┐
│ Component       │ Specification           │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ Processor       │ Pentium IV 2.8GHz      │
│ Memory          │ 512MB (2x256MB)        │
│ Storage         │ 40GB HDD (4 partitions)│
│ Display         │ 17" CRT "Slim" Edition │
│ OS              │ Windows XP Professional │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘

Note: Core 2 Duo was still a year away :(
```

I **adored** that machine. While my classmates struggled with school's ancient Celeron PCs running Windows 98 with 64MB RAM, I'd rush home to fire up GTA III with those "insane" graphics and unleash chaos with the `GUNSGUNSGUNS` cheat code.

## The Curiosity Rabbit Hole

```bash
$ sudo rm -rf /windows/system32/*
Permission denied: Common sense not found
```

Being naturally curious (read: destructive), I may have "accidentally" deleted some "useless" files from `C:\Windows\System32` more times than I care to admit. This led to my first adventures with dual-booting Ubuntu and Linux Mint - though I was way too much of a n00b to understand the raw power I was playing with.

Then I met my mentor: a guy whose Orkut handle was **"T3C#N0_HAXXOR"** (peak 2005 energy right there). He handed me an old issue of Digit magazine and said, "Read this."

That night, I devoured every page. It was the first time I'd ever read anything with such intensity. I became a lifelong Digit subscriber that day (still am, actually).

While the DVDs were initially the treasure, the articles opened my eyes to what was happening **behind the scenes**. I became the neighborhood "IT guy" - the kid who could fix anything through determination and liberal application of Google-fu.

## Hello, World!

```html
<!-- My first creation, circa 2006 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Jatin's Movie Collection</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my epic local website!</h1>
    <marquee>This is probably the coolest thing ever</marquee>
</body>
</html>
```

While browsing through a Digit DVD in 9th grade, I discovered Microsoft FrontPage. This kickstarted my web development journey - I created local HTML pages for everything: movie directories, song collections, you name it.

I even learned basic Macromedia Flash to create "animations" (read: bouncing balls and spinning text) to embed in my masterpieces.

The feeling of creating something **functional** was intoxicating.

Then "T3C#N0_HAXXOR" saw my work and laughed: *"HTML isn't real programming! Come to my place and I'll show you how to create REAL SOFTWARE!"*

He opened up a DOS-like blue screen - Turbo C++ - and typed the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen:

```cpp
#include<iostream.h>
#include<conio.h>

void main()
{
    clrscr();
    cout << "Hello World!";
    getch();
}
```

When he hit compile and run, the screen went black and displayed "Hello World!" in simple white text.

I was **hooked** again.

I checked out "Let us C++ by Yashavant Kanetkar" from the school library and dove headfirst into the world of compilers. While my peers were learning basic HTML, I was writing programs to calculate prime numbers and pi digits.

The possibilities felt endless.

## Building the Foundation

```python
career_decision = {
    "high_school_stream": "Non-Medical with Computer Science",
    "focus_shift": "from Math to Coding",
    "performance": {
        "programming_exams": "near perfect",
        "other_subjects": "barely passing"
    }
}
```

Taking Computer Science in high school was obvious. We started with C in 11th grade and moved to C++ in 12th. My interest shifted so dramatically from mathematics to programming that while I was scoring full marks in coding exams, I was barely scraping through other "science" subjects.

That's when I knew this would be my career.

A friend's dad, who was a computer architect, gave me crucial advice: *"Focus on data structures and algorithms - they're the foundation. Syntax is just sugar."*

This made perfect sense. Computers ultimately work with transistors and logic gates. If your code isn't efficient, it's nearly useless.

I bought "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas Cormen and spent the next two years exploring space/time complexities, memory allocation, and the art of avoiding exponential runtimes in favor of logarithmic ones.

## The College Years

```bash
$ college-decision --year=2008
Warning: IT sector recession detected
Dad's recommendation: EEE/MAE ("core-evergreen branches")
My choice: B.Tech CSE
Risk level: High
Faith level: Higher
```

Despite the 2008 recession making IT seem risky, and my dad pushing for "safer" engineering branches, I took a leap of faith with Computer Science Engineering.

College was... college. Most people were obsessed with cramming notes and chasing grades rather than understanding the innovation side of engineering. It's a problem in India - everyone (students and faculty) focuses more on scoring well than actually grasping the essence of engineering.

But I found my tribe in mobile app development. I started building apps, pushing code to GitHub, contributing to peer projects. The learning accelerated exponentially from there.

I'll stop here before this turns into a resume - you can catch the rest on my LinkedIn. 😉

## The Why

```javascript
const whyTech = () => {
    return {
        curiosity: "How does this actually work?",
        creation: "Building something from nothing",
        problem_solving: "Everything can be modularized and solved",
        continuous_learning: "Technology never stops evolving",
        impact: "Code can change the world"
    };
};
```

Growing up, I was obsessively curious about technology - and I still am. I developed a taste for understanding the intrinsics of how things work, partly thanks to my dad who would grab his screwdriver and fix anything broken without hesitation.

My dad, being an engineer himself, taught me that everything is built by humans and can be understood, modularized, and solved efficiently. That philosophy happens to be the core of Computer Science.

So that's why tech - it's the perfect blend of creativity, logic, and endless possibility.
