Six months ago, our team made the leap from Docker Swarm to Kubernetes for our production workloads. **Kubernetes has transformed how we think about deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications**.

## Core Kubernetes Concepts

### Deployments and Services

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
```

## Configuration Management

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: app-config
data:
  database-url: "postgres://db:5432/app"
  log-level: "info"
```

## Health Checks and Scaling

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /health
    port: 3000
readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 3000
```

Kubernetes provides declarative configuration, automatic scaling, rolling deployments, and self-healing capabilities that make production deployments reliable and manageable.

**The key is starting simple and growing your Kubernetes expertise alongside your application complexity.**
