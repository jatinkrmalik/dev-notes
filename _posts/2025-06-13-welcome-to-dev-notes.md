## Welcome to my digital brain dump

After years of keeping technical notes scattered across Notion, random text files, and the occasional napkin, I've finally decided to centralize my **raw technical explorations** in one place. This is where unpolished thoughts meet real-world engineering challenges.

### What you'll find here

```yaml
content_focus:
  distributed_systems: 70%
  home_lab_adventures: 20% 
  engineering_leadership: 10%
  
posting_frequency: "irregular but authentic"
content_style: "unpolished thoughts from the trenches"
target_audience: ["fellow engineers", "system architects", "technical leaders"]
```

This isn't your typical polished tech blog. These are **actual dev notes** - the kind you'd find in my terminal history, scattered across my home lab servers, or hastily jotted down during architecture reviews at Atlassian.

### Coming soon

Over the next few weeks, I'll be migrating a decade worth of technical notes covering:

- **Distributed Systems**: Real-world patterns from building systems at scale
- **Performance Engineering**: War stories from optimizing high-throughput applications  
- **Home Lab Adventures**: Docker optimization, ML experiments, and Raspberry Pi networking
- **Cloud Architecture**: Multi-cloud deployment strategies and trade-offs
- **Engineering Leadership**: Lessons from scaling technical teams

### The setup

This blog runs on a custom **retro CRT terminal theme** because nostalgia meets functionality. Built with Jekyll, optimized for GitHub Pages, and designed to feel like the terminals that shaped my early engineering years.

```scss
:root[data-theme="dark"] {
  --text-primary: #00ff00;  // That authentic green phosphor glow
  --bg-primary: #000000;    // True terminal black
}
```

### Why now?

After spending years optimizing **Docker containers** for distributed systems at work, I come home to a different kind of lab - one where I can experiment without breaking production, explore machine learning without GPU budget constraints, and document the intersection of professional backend engineering with personal technical curiosity.

*More technical deep dives coming soon. Until then, happy debugging!*
