Hello, World!

jatin@dev-notes:~$ Principal Engineer passionate about distributed systems

## Welcome to my digital brain dump

After years of keeping technical notes scattered across Notion, random text files, and the occasional napkin, I've finally decided to centralize my **raw technical explorations** in one place. This is where unpolished thoughts meet real-world engineering challenges.


```bash
$ git log --oneline -1
a1b2c3d Initial commit: Welcome to the chaos
$ git push origin main
$ echo "Ready to share a decade of dev notes..."
Ready to share a decade of dev notes...
$ █
```

*More technical deep dives coming soon. Until then, happy debugging!*
